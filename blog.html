The attached Coca Cola lid is also so annoying to close, I might not be buying Coca Cola anymore in the future just because of it.</div>

Cleaning my dishes when suddenly my Coca Cola glass from McDonalds breaks and cuts me. Did they hear about me complaining about the new Coca Cola bottle "attached" lid? (They're terrible and completely unusable, I've also several times almost cut myself on them when I tried removing them.) Fortunately it's just a small cut.</div>

Watched a few videos about building guitar pedals, seems interesting, found some electronics shop nearby and it seems like it is affordable (so why do companies charge 100x as much?), might try it out one day.</div>

Trump was right. When they can go after a president candidate, the president, former president and yet again president candidate, when they can steal the election, rig the process, create multiple hoaxes and spin up the Fake News Propaganda Machine, what's stopping them to go after you, the average citizen. Nothing. Nothing's stopping them, and they will go after. They are going after you. And they have gone after you.</div>

The Deep State has compromised accounts of people close to me, they use these accounts to discredit me and to suppress my speech. They cite non-existent rules and rules made up on the spot to ban me from discussions, yet they don't ban anyone else for the same or worse offences.</div>

I was right to doubt, the chicken was still frozen.</div>

The Fake News Media and the Corrupt Radical Left Democrats have colluded to have my constitutional right to freedom of speech suppressed and to deny my voice being heard, because I speak the Truth about Real Topics, they don't like the Real Topics, they don't want to be reminded of the threats that are looming, they keep their heads high in the clouds, and buried deep in the sand, they hate the Truth.</div>

Took my chicken out of the freezer and into the fridge, I was told it'd unfreeze, I'm a doubter though.</div>

Ordered McDonalds - McRoyal menu and a McFlurry, put my McFlurry into the freezer so that it doesn't melt, now my McFlurry is frozen hard and I can't mix the ingredients, Sadge.</div>
