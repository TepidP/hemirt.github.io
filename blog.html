Banana split chocolate ice cream is good OpieOP. 2 of my rakuten orders already arrived but the third one is taking its time ResidentSleeper. Hopefully the global shipping wont cost too much.</p>

Aaaah it's so hot outside. 33 °C. No AC in doors either Sadge. I don't even feel like eating at all. I don't get it how fat people can be fat. In these hot weathers, they ought to be like superheated, and yet they can eat like 5 times a daily amount. Should I call it amazing or disgusting. Aargh, atleast I got some McFlurry.</p>

I don't understand the deal with abortions, if someone wants to have them for any reason at all, why not allow them. Give a reasonable time frame for it to be legal (afaik if it were to be prematurely born it would have troubles to survive even past second trimester). And let them, rather than letting them hate the child. Too many people get pointlessly worked up over abortions instead of things they should be angered about, such as genital mutilation in baby boys called circumcision. Pointless, barbaric (often done without any medications or pain anesthetics), without consent, and often resulting in complications.</p>

Bought a Tiramisu ice cream, and the tiramisu flavour is quite meh, never buying anything tiramisu again. Curse the store for not having my favourite of vanilla and chocoolate.</p>

Leaving kids be kids and saying that they cannot consent to gender surgeries is a controversial take nowadays. Let them choose if they still think so after they are adults. Some people think that environmental factors are nonexistent. They are taught this via the media, their brains are getting altered by social media and tik tok content. What world are we living in?</p>

When a violent mob and a guy with an AK comes up to your car and threatens you, you have every right to self-defense. "Just drive away" yeah, when the violent mob is all around you and 1) there's no safe way to drive away, 2) your car'd get drilled with bullets before you'd even shift into first gear. Demonstrations should be pre-approved and cordoned-off by the police, but that's not something the "DEFUND THE POLICE" crowd and the "protestors (rioters & looters)" on the left actually want. Good that the governor wants to pardon him.</p>

I created a new bank account which wants me to send a transaction from other one to verify it. But they don't support instant transactions (I looked in the central bank notes and they're not there either). And they have the nerve to send me an email that "I haven't sent the verification transaction yet" FeelsIQMan. Dude, the system is from 2018.</p>

Radical snowflake liberals being surprised that the bill touted as "stopping transgender women (i.e. men i.e. males) in women's (i.e. female) sports" would also stop those men going into women's changing rooms, locker rooms, and restrooms, and also stop transgedering underage children. Whiny democrats saying that it got "sneaked in" and that it was "never about women's sports". It was about women's sports, and it was about stopping males in female spaces, it was always about that. Always.</p>

"Cash App founder, MobileCoin CPO Bob Lee stabbed to death in San Francisco's Rincon Hill neighborhood" - even I know not to walk in SF. There are people saying that he should have known better and not walk around late at night, or that he should have been armed. I believe those people are right. And the people saying not to "victim blame" are retarded. You can say and be completely valid and right that something is dangerous and you should not do it. It's like saying that if you walk into the middle of a police officer and a criminal shooting at each other and then you get shot, that you take no blame. Completely retarded. Also, if you're a millionaire, why tf you walking around at 2 am in homeless & crime infested SF, complete lack of awareness. Btw Mobilecoin, iirc, it's that scam coin signal created - for centralization (so they control it), speed (okay, valid), premined, largely centrally owned, developed by people with close ties to signal's executives, and secretly dumped - scam coin, don't buy, don't use.</p>

I don't understand why some twitch streamers do competitions or challenges between each other for gifted subs. They're literally giving 50 % to amazon and whatever % to government in taxes again (sales tax and income tax).</p>

Why are my twitch emotes still pending, it's been like 5 days, two emotes got approved instantly and last three emotes are pending FeelsWeirdMan.</p>

Gonna buy a ledger hardware wallet to store my crypto securely, could not really find a respectable and well reviewed desktop wallet for ethereum. Might aswell buy some other things, maybe the digital audio interface.</p>

There's a lot of news article on somewhat legitimate and on somewhat weird news websites talking about FTX EU letting the customers withdraw their assets, with a link to a web address, which is also on the Cyprus government records. But the website looks like the most scam-like phishing website. Also the eu domain is registered by GoDaddy and not by Amazon as the com domain is, which is also weird. Maybe someone snatched the domain after it expired? Some peple are saying that FTX EU customers would be made whole, which would be quite POGGERS. I got an email which lists me as part of FTX EU, and it also includes a claim on sign up bonus fee rebate. So I could even make money of this Pog. No emails about this website tho, so I believe it to be a scam. We'll see.</p>

Youtube certainly needs to figure out that no normal person listens to music at x2 speed and should automatically switch to x1, smh.</p>

Yet again some more problems with audio on linux (debian). There's always some problem with pulseaudio, pipewire-pulse, pipewire-wireplumber... I also seem to be getting problems with xfce locking / freezing for several seconds (other apps work), for example the panel does not work, but the clicked elements (or scrolled volume) opens like 20-30 seconds later. No idea how to fix it, upgrading to newer versions does not fix it. Only restarts fix it.</p>
<p class="post">2023-03-31
Today was a first time someone donating DOGE coin Pog. I'm thinking of buying a digital audio interface, but haven't got any idea which. And I hope they work with linux monkaS.</p>

PagMan Cloudflare offers super neat thing that some other services offer, but they offer it for €5/m or €50/y whilst on Cloudflare it's free. Quite Pog!</p>

Tweeted at Coingecko and they fixed it FeelsGoodMan, <a href="/coins">Coins</a> page now works. Also added filtering to blog.</p>
<p class="post">2023-03-29
Coingecko seems to have fucked up something and now I can't access it via the <a href="/coins">Coins</a> page, neither via curl nor in my webbrowser. Hopefully fix soon Sadge</p>

Went to the guitar store, bought some new strings and guitar picks, they're kinda cool, and then changed my strings. They now sound great FeelsGoodMan. The internet went down for quite some time tho. Also found some last pieces of non-shit lid Coca Cola so I bought two of them. Bought two Pepsi too.</p>
<p class="post">2023-03-27
The attached Coca Cola lid is also so annoying to close, I might not be buying Coca Cola anymore in the future just because of it.</p>
<p class="post">2023-03-27
Cleaning my dishes when suddenly my Coca Cola glass from McDonalds breaks and cuts me. Did they hear about me complaining about the new Coca Cola bottle "attached" lid? (They're terrible and completely unusable, I've also several times almost cut myself on them when I tried removing them.) Fortunately it's just a small cut.</p>

Watched a few videos about building guitar pedals, seems interesting, found some electronics shop nearby and it seems like it is affordable (so why do companies charge 100x as much?), might try it out one day.</p>

Trump was right. When they can go after a president candidate, the president, former president and yet again president candidate, when they can steal the election, rig the process, create multiple hoaxes and spin up the Fake News Propaganda Machine, what's stopping them to go after you, the average citizen. Nothing. Nothing's stopping them, and they will go after. They are going after you. And they have gone after you.</p>

The Deep State has compromised accounts of people close to me, they use these accounts to discredit me and to suppress my speech. They cite non-existent rules and rules made up on the spot to ban me from discussions, yet they don't ban anyone else for the same or worse offences.</p>

I was right to doubt, the chicken was still frozen.</p>
<p class="post">2023-03-26
The Fake News Media and the Corrupt Radical Left Democrats have colluded to have my constitutional right to freedom of speech suppressed and to deny my voice being heard, because I speak the Truth about Real Topics, they don't like the Real Topics, they don't want to be reminded of the threats that are looming, they keep their heads high in the clouds, and buried deep in the sand, they hate the Truth.</p>
<p class="post">2023-03-25
Took my chicken out of the freezer and into the fridge, I was told it'd unfreeze, I'm a doubter though.</p>

Ordered McDonalds - McRoyal menu and a McFlurry, put my McFlurry into the freezer so that it doesn't melt, now my McFlurry is frozen hard and I can't mix the ingredients, Sadge.</p>
